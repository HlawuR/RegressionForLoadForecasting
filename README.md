## Regression Sprint: Team NM2
This repository contains code developed by Team NM2 during the regression sprint as part of the Data Science program at Explore Data Science Academy.

## Overview
The project focuses on regression modeling to predict load shortfall. Our team worked on developing and fine-tuning regression models to accurately forecast load shortfall.

### Project Structure
- data/: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- utils/: Utility functions and scripts used in data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
###Requirements
- Python3
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc. (see requirements.txt for full list)
### Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/KgasagoGH/Regression-sprint-2307FTDS-Team-NM2.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Regression-sprint-2307FTDS-Team-NM2
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to understand the data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation processes.

Use the utility scripts in the utils/ directory for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
